For my project you look at sections at a time. Each section is labeled and I tried to put wait timers so that the 
screen didn't flood with text.

I've been busy with eoc's and ap tests so i wasnt able to implament everything I wanted to so at the moment after you pick
a section and go into it you have to call main() to restart the program.

So when you want to go to a section You have to use capitol letters (except for random because its random) and you have to 
make sure you either have the turtle graphics window splitscreened or use 2 monitors.
